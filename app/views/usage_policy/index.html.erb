	which a client would have gained if their site was functioning. Certain 
	services provided by Codetry are resold. Thus, certain equipment,

	<br>

	<br>
	As a provider of web site hosting and other Internet-related services, 
	Codetry offers its customer (also known as &quot;Subscribers&quot;) 
	and their customers and users the means to acquire and disseminate a wealth 
	of public, private, commercial and non-commercial information. Codetry 
	respects that the Internet provides a forum for free and open discussion 
	and dissemination of information. However, when there are competing interests 
	at issue, Codetry reserves the right to take certain preventive 
	or corrective actions. In order to protect these competing interests, 
	Codetry has developed an <strong>Acceptable Use Policy (&quot;AUP&quot;)</strong>, 
	which supplements and explains certain terms of each customer's respective 
	service agreement, and is intended as a guide to the customer's rights 
	and obligations when using Codetry' services. This AUP will be revised 
	from time to time. </p>
	<p>One important aspect of the Internet is that no one party owns or controls 
	it. This fact accounts for much of the Internet's openness and value, 
	but it also places a high premium on the judgment and responsibility of 
	those who use it, both in the information they acquire and in the information 
	they disseminate to others. When subscribers obtain information through 
	the Internet, they must keep in mind that Codetry cannot monitor, 
	verify, warrant or vouch for the accuracy and quality of the information 
	they acquire. For this reason, the subscriber must exercise his or her 
	best judgment in relying on information obtained from the Internet, and 
	also should be aware that some material posted to the Internet may be 
	sexually explicit or otherwise offensive. Because Codetry cannot 
	monitor or censor the Internet, and will not attempt to do so, Codetry 
	cannot accept any responsibility for injury to its subscribers resulting 
	from inaccurate, unsuitable, offensive or illegal Internet communications. 
	</p>
	<p>When subscribers disseminate information from the Internet, they must 
	keep in mind that Codetry does not review, edit, censor or take 
	responsibility for any information its subscribers may create. When users 
	place information on the Internet, they have the same liability as other 
	authors for copyright infringement, defamation and other harmful speech. 
	Also, because the information created is carried over Codetry' 
	network and may reach a large number of people, including both subscribers 
	and non-subscribers of Codetry, subscribers' postings to the Internet 
	may affect other subscribers and may affect Codetry' goodwill, 
	business, reputation or operations. For these reasons, subscribers violate 
	Codetry policy and the Service Agreement when they, their customers, 
	affiliates or subsidiaries engage in the following prohibited activities: 
	</p>
	<p><strong>Spamming:</strong> <br>
	Sending unsolicited bulk and/or commercial information over the Internet. 
	It is not only harmful because of its negative impact on consumer attitudes 
	toward Codetry, but also because it can overload Codetry' 
	network and disrupt service to Codetry' subscribers. Also, 
	maintaining an open SMTP relay is prohibited. When a complaint is received, 
	Codetry will investigate and shutdown the account that is 
	SPAMing. A $250 charge for violating this policy will be charged to the 
	person initiating the SPAM. Furthermore Codetry reserves 
	the right to prosecute for this violation. A $1.00 charge will be assessed 
	PER EMAIL sent should Codetry choose to pursue and prosecute. 
	</p>
	<p><strong>Audio/Video Streaming</strong>: <br>
	Audio/Video Streaming is not hosting friendly. As such, Codetry 
	does not allow any streaming of audio or video content. Offending accounts 
	will be suspended without noticed or terminated. </p>
	<p><strong>Adult-Oriented Content: </strong><br>
	Codetry does not allow adult content and will suspend/terminate 
	any offending account.</p>
	<p><strong>Large File Policy: </strong><br>
	Codetry is not for file hosting and distribution - as such, 
	customers may not host any files larger than 50MB in size that are observed 
	to be available for the sole purpose of download. Such files include but 
	are not limited to .ISO, audio/video files, .EXE files. If you are unsure 
	whether your file is against this policy, please e-mail contact@codetry.org. </p>
	<p><strong>Obscene Speech or Materials:</strong> <br>
	Using Codetry' network to advertise, transmit, store, post, display, 
	or otherwise make available child pornography or obscene speech or material 
	is prohibited. Codetry is required by law to notify law enforcement 
	agencies when it becomes aware of the presence of child pornography on 
	or being transmitted through its network. </p>
	<p><strong>Defamatory or Abusive Language:</strong> <br>
	Using Codetry' network as a means to transmit or post negative, 
	defamatory, harassing, abusive or threatening language. </p>
	<p><strong>Forging of Headers:<br>
	</strong>Forging or misrepresenting message headers, whether in whole 
	or in part, to mask the originator of the message. </p>
	<p><strong>Illegal or Unauthorized Access to Other Computers or Networks: 
	</strong><br>
	Accessing, illegally or without authorization, computers, accounts or 
	networks belonging to another party, or attempting to penetrate security 
	measures of another individual's system (often known as &quot;hacking&quot;). 
	Also, any activity that may be used as a precursor to an attempted system 
	penetration (i.e., port scan, stealth scan or other information-gathering 
	activity). </p>
	<p><strong>Distribution of Internet Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses or Other 
	Destructive Activities</strong>: <br>
	Distributing information regarding the creation of and sending Internet 
	viruses, worms, Trojan horses, pinging, flooding, mail bombing or denial 
	of service attacks. Also, activities that disrupt the use of or interfere 
	with the ability of others to effectively use the network or any connected 
	network, system, service or equipment. </p>
	<p><strong>Facilitation a Violation of this AUP:</strong> <br>
	Advertising, transmitting or otherwise making available any software, 
	program, product or service that is designed to violate this AUP, which 
	includes the facilitation of the means to spam, initiation of pinging, 
	flooding, mail bombing, denial of service attacks and piracy of software. 
	</p>
	<p><strong>Export Control Violations:</strong> <br>
	Exporting encryption software over the Internet or otherwise, to points 
	outside the United States. </p>
	<p><strong>Usenet Groups:</strong> <br>
	Codetry reserves the right not to accept postings from newsgroups 
	where we have actual knowledge that the content of the newsgroup violates 
	the AUP. </p>
	<p><strong>Other Illegal Activities: </strong><br>
	Engaging in activities that are determined to be illegal, including, but 
	not limited to, advertising, transmitting or otherwise making available 
	ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes, fraudulently charging credit cards and 
	pirating software. </p>
	<p><strong>Other Activities: </strong><br>
	Engaging in activities, whether lawful or unlawful, that Codetry 
	determines to be harmful to its subscribers, operations, reputation, goodwill 
	or customer relations. </p>
	<p>As we have pointed out, the responsibility for avoiding harmful activities 
	just described rests primarily with the subscriber. Codetry will 
	not, as an ordinary practice, monitor the communications of its subscribers 
	to ensure that the comply with Codetry' policy or applicable law. 
	However, when Codetry becomes aware of harmful activities, it may 
	take any action to stop the harmful activity, including, but not limited 
	to, removal of information, shutting down a web site, implementing screening 
	software designed to block offending transmissions, denying access to 
	the Internet, or any other action deemed appropriate by Codetry. 
	</p>
	<p>Codetry is also aware that many of its subscribers are themselves 
	providers of Internet services, and that information reaching Codetry' 
	facilities from those subscribers may have originated from a customer 
	of the subscriber or from another third party. Codetry does not 
	require its subscribers who offer Internet services to monitor or censor 
	transmissions or web sites created by customers of its subscribers. Codetry 
	reserves the right to directly take action against a customer of its subscribers. 
	Also, Codetry may take action against the Codetry' subscriber 
	because of activities of a customer of the subscriber, even though the 
	action may affect other customers of the subscriber. Similarly, Codetry 
	anticipates that subscribers who offer Internet services will cooperate 
	with Codetry in any corrective or preventive action that Codetry 
	deems necessary. Failure to cooperate with such corrective or preventive 
	measures is a violation of Codetry policy. </p>
	<p>Codetry will not intentionally monitor private electronic mail 
	messages sent or receive by its subscribers, unless required to do so 
	by law, governmental authority or when public safety is at stake. Codetry 
	may, however, monitor its service electronically to determine that its 
	facilities are operating satisfactorily. Also, Codetry may disclose 
	information, including, but not limited to, information concerning a subscriber, 
	a transmission made using our network, or a web site, in order to comply 
	with a court order, subpoena, summons, discovery request, warrant, statute, 
	regulation or governmental request. Codetry assumes not obligation 
	to inform the subscriber that subscriber information has been provided 
	and, in some cases, may be prohibited by law from giving such notice. 
	Finally, Codetry may disclose subscriber information or information 
	transmitted over its network where necessary to protect Codetry 
	and others from harm, or where such disclosure is necessary to the proper 
	operation of the system. However, Codetry will never sell information 
	to other services or outside companies. </p>
	<p>Codetry expects that its subscribers who provide Internet services 
	to others will comply fully with all applicable laws concerning the privacy 
	of online communications. A subscriber's failure to comply with those 
	laws will violate Codetry policy. Finally, Codetry wishes 
	to emphasize that, in signing the Service Agreement, subscribers indemnify 
	Codetry for any violation of the Service Agreement, law or Codetry 
	policy resulting in loss to Codetry or the bringing of any claim 
	against Codetry by any third party. This means that, if Codetry 
	is sued because of a subscriber's or customer of a subscriber's activity, 
	the subscriber will be responsible for payment of any damages awarded 
	against Codetry, plus costs and reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
	<p>We hope this AUP is helpful in clarifying the obligations of Internet 
	users, including Codetry and its subscribers, as responsible 
	members of the Internet. Any complaints about a subscriber's violation 
	of this AUP should be sent to contact@codetry.org.
